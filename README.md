# What is ecoeats

Ecoeats is a fictional project, with the goal of creating something on top of it. This is a project for college, for academic purposes only.

# What is this project

The project is to create a website or an app for the `fictitious company`, my team decided to do both. However, so far we only have the website.

# The site

The website is here

| Site |  Links |
| ------ | ------ |
|  Ecoeats |  https://github.com/suchsoak/ecoeats/blob/main/Site/ecoeats/Site.png

In the moment the site isn't responsive and just have the firt page.

# The app

In the moment the app isn't ready, but i have here the design

| Aplicativo |  Links |
| ------ | ------ |
|  Ecoeats |  https://github.com/suchsoak/ecoeats/tree/main/Aplicativo

If i dont say before, i will say now. This stil on develope. **Is not ready**

# If it's not ready, why do I put it here?
Because it has an expiration date for me to put the project in, if it's not the programming part. It was ready, just by design.

# Code

| Code |  Links |
| ------ | ------ |
|  html |  https://github.com/suchsoak/ecoeats/blob/main/Site/ecoeats/index.html
|  css |  https://github.com/suchsoak/ecoeats/blob/main/Site/ecoeats/index.css
|  javascript |  https://github.com/suchsoak/ecoeats/blob/main/Site/ecoeats/index.js
|  dart |  https://github.com/suchsoak/ecoeats/blob/main/Aplicativo/main.dart

# Project 

In this section, I will present the project to the client in a way that resembles a verbal explanation. When discussing the website and app, it is important to provide clear information about both the technical aspects and the time required for development. This includes the design and programming components, with the programming aspect naturally requiring more time. As someone with some programming knowledge, I know that this process takes time. Additionally, it is necessary to attend to budgetary considerations, as the cost varies depending on whether the customer wants only the website, only the app, or both. Should the decision be made to create both the website and the app, it is important to note that this would involve a significant investment. It's important to recognize that allies serve different purposes for different platforms and target audiences, which raises a number of design-related questions. In addition, the company would also take care of the aspect of the merchandise as it has the ability to produce it in-house.

# Now talking about the repository

I can't say when the project will be ready, but one day it will be. Because of that I'm going to put it in beta.
